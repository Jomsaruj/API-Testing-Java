## Testing Domain

Here are some test cases to test Suchonâ€™s Site web application API. This API is a JSON-based API. All requests are made to endpoints beginning:   
 

```
https://suchonsite-server.herokuapp.com/
```    

All requests must be secure, i.e. `https`, not `http`.

## API Documentation

**Pattern 1: retrieve the information of all appointment** Return full list of people's information that have vaccination appointment

The API endpoint exposes this list of people's information as a collection.A request to fetch a list of people's information looks like this:    

```
GET https://suchonsite-server.herokuapp.com/people/all
```

Example response:
```
[
    {
        "_id": "string",
        "date": "20-10-2021",
        "people": [
            {
                "reservation_id": 1,
                "register_timestamp": "2021-10-20T15:19:56.609000",
                "name": "string",

    },
    {
        "_id": "string",
        "date": "21-10-2021",
        "people": [
            {

                "register_timestamp": "2021-10-21T15:19:56.609000",

]
```

| Status code	| Msg| Description   |

| 200 | OK |  occur when get successfully |

**Pattern 2: retrieve the information of peoples appointment by date**
Return full list of people's information that have vaccination appointment in that day    

The API endpoint exposes this list of people's information as a collection.A request to fetch a list of people's information looks like this:    

```
GET https://suchonsite-server.herokuapp.com/people/by_date/dd-mm-yyyy
```

Example response:
```
{
    "_id": "617042a299a86369e7ba81f5",
    "date": "20-10-2021",
    "people": [
        {
            "reservation_id": 1,
            "register_timestamp": "string",
            "name": "string",

            "priority": "string"
        }
    ],
    "__v": 0
}
```
| Status code	| Msg| Description   |
|---|---|---|
| 404 | Not Found |  occur when get invalid param such as /people/by_date/10-July-2020 |
| 202 | no date included |  occur when not get any date /people/by_date/ |
| 200 | OK |  occur when get successfully |

**Pattern 3: retrieve the information from GOV and push to database**

This API end-point need to modify (may be chabge from POST to GET), but the objective of this route is to GET user information form GOV and then process it before store in our database.

```
POST https://suchonsite-server.herokuapp.com/getDataFromGov{{date}}
```
It is a POST request without body (that is the reason why we have to modify it)

| Status code	| Msg| Description   |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | already have data in this date |  occur when get duplicate data from GOV |
| 504 | gov status code != 200 | occur when unable to fetch information form GOV |
| 202 | no date included |  occur when not get any date /getDataFromGov |
| 200 | OK |  occur when get successfully |
